Set 1:
This set consists of instances generated by Helmberg and Rendl (2000) 
who used rudy, a machine-independent graph generator by Giovanni Rinaldi, 
to create 54 instances ranging from n = 800 to 3,000. 
They consist of 
toroidal, 
planar, 
and random 
graphs with weights taking the values 1, 0, or −1. 
Burer et al. (2001) and Festa et al. (2002) used these graphs in their experiments.

Set2:
This set contains 30 instances described in Festa et al. (2002). 
The first 10 are small-size instances with an average of 128 vertices and 300 edges,
the second 10 instances are medium-size graphs with 1,000 vertices and density equal to 0.60%, 
and the last 10 are large-size instances with 2,744 vertices and density equal to 0.22%. 
The weight values are either 1, 0, or −1. 

Set 3: 
The four instances in this set come from the 7th DIMACS Implementation Challenge. 
The number of vertices ranges from 512 to 3,375 and the number of edges from 1,536 to 10,125. 
Burer et al. (2001) used all four instances in their experiments. 
Festa et al. (2002) considered only one.

Set 4:
Graphs taken from "Biq Mac Library - Binary quadratic and Max cut Library", they consist of 50 nodes and the max edges count is 147. 

Set 5:
Graphs created by my own graph generator with a line and temperature to calculate the edge count. 
Wrong graph structre (loops). 10-20 nodes in size.

Set 6:
Graphs created by my own graph generator with a line and temperature to calculate the edge count.
Corrected loops issue. 10-20 nodes in size.
