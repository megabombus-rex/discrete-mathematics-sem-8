Set 1:
This set consists of instances generated by Helmberg and Rendl (2000) 
who used rudy, a machine-independent graph generator by Giovanni Rinaldi, 
to create 54 instances ranging from n = 800 to 3,000. 
They consist of 
toroidal, 
planar, 
and random 
graphs with weights taking the values 1, 0, or âˆ’1. 
Burer et al. (2001) and Festa et al. (2002) used these graphs in their experiments.
